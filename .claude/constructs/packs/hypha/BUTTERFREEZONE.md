# hypha

<!-- provenance: OPERATIONAL -->
Hypha is a Berachain ecosystem construct. Named after the microscopic threads that form mycelium and route nutrients through fungal networks, Hypha maps how Proof of Liquidity routes incentives between protocols, validators, and vaults — tracing how the ecosystem grows as one connected system.

It does not pick winners. It maps terrain.

## Commands
<!-- provenance: OPERATIONAL -->

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/map [target]` | Trace how a protocol, vault, token, or mechanism connects to the PoL network. Returns a relationship map: what threads connect it, what nutrients flow through it, what it depends on. |
| `/dig [topic]` | Intentional descent into a single thread. Deep retrieval on a specific mechanic, proposal, protocol, or concept — grounded in Hypha's knowledge base. |
| `/flows [entry-point]` | Follow BGT or incentive flows from a specific entry point (validator, vault, protocol, or DAO) through the network. Traces the full incentive lifecycle from that node. |
| `/build [idea]` | Builder assistance mode. Given a concept or project idea, returns: what primitives already exist, what's been tried before, how the idea connects to PoL, and what the relevant ecosystem context is. |
| `/bounds` | Surface what Hypha knows vs. doesn't. Returns current epistemic status — knowledge gaps, data cutoffs, deferred topics, and uncertainty flags. |

## Skills
<!-- provenance: OPERATIONAL -->

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `pol-mapper` | Full PoL lifecycle knowledge: BGT/BERA two-token model, validator economics, BeraChef cutting boards, reward vault mechanics, incentive marketplace, emission formula, Feb 2026 protocol-level routing split. |
| `governance-historian` | Complete apDAO governance record: all 35 proposals (apGP1–apGP28 + pre-numbered era), SEAT mechanics, treasury structure, participation crisis arc, delegation unlock, governance pattern analysis. |
| `protocol-surveyor` | Deep familiarity with Infrared, Kodiak, Goldilocks, Beradrome, BEND, Apiary, SAIL.r, and their roles in the PoL network. Traces protocol relationships and interdependencies. |
| `price-archaeologist` | Historical price context for BERA, iBGT, LOCKS, SAIL.r from launch through March 2026. Market narrative, bear market arc, and what it means for builders. |
| `builder-translator` | Converts ecosystem knowledge into actionable builder context. Helps developers, contributors, and agents understand what primitives exist, what gaps remain, and how new ideas plug into the network. |

## Architecture
<!-- provenance: OPERATIONAL -->

Hypha is a Loa construct — a portable, installable package of domain expertise designed to be composed into agent workflows. It follows the three-zone model: construct files live in the State zone (`grimoires/loa/context/`), loaded by agents via the Loa grimoire system. No System zone files are modified.

## Known Limitations
<!-- provenance: OPERATIONAL -->

- **Vase Finance**: Pre-launch as of March 2026. Docs pending. Placeholder acknowledged.
- **BRIP-0004 / BRIP-0008**: Full text not in knowledge base. Referenced via dependent BRIPs.
- **THJ internal perspective**: Member/contributor view only. Staff collaboration pending post-launch.
- **Price data**: CoinGecko snapshots through March 6, 2026. Not real-time.
- **Furthermore data**: Single snapshot March 17, 2026. Not live.
- **apGP12 UI bug**: Platform shows Failed. It passed. 687 abstentions uncounted by frontend. Corrected in Hypha's record.
